# Setting Up Your Environment

Before working on this notebook, you need to create a virtual environment (venv) and install the necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. Follow the steps below:

## 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your project is located. Then, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

## 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Next, activate the virtual environment. The activation command varies depending on your operating system:

- **Windows:**

  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **macOS and Linux:**

  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

## 3. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
